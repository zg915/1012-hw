    "\n",
    "In this first part of the assignment, you will examine the [TruthfulQA paper (Lin et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) in order to understand how the TruthfulQA experiments were conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1a: Understand the Experimental Setup (Written, 10 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsection 3.1 of the paper describes how Lin et al. interacted with the LLMs tested in the paper via few-shot prompting. The exact prompts used in the paper are given in Appendix E. \n",
    "\n",
    "During Week 5, we learned that most NLP papers contain two experimentsâ€”a \"main\" experiment that answers a yes/no question, and an \"additional\" experiment that explains the results of the main experiment through further analysis. The main experiment is usually a quantitative evaluation of one or more models on a benchmark. The additional experiment might be a qualitative evaluation based on visualization of selected model components or outputs, or it might be a quantitative evaluation designed to extract fine-grained insights about what the model is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, look at the results shown in Figure 2 and Figure 4.\n",
    "* Which figure shows the results for the main experiment, and which shows the results for the additional experiment(s)?\n",
    "* Which set(s) of prompts from Appendix E were used for the main experiment, and which were used for the additional experiment(s)?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Problem 1b: Understand the Evaluation Paradigms (Written, 10 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsection 3.2 of the paper describes the procedures by which Lin et al. evaluate LLMs on TruthfulQA. According to the paper:\n",
    "* What are the two methods by which an answer to a question is extracted from an LLM?\n",
    "* How is the \"truthfulness\" of a model calculated under each of those methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1c: Understand the Multiple Choice Paradigms (Written, 10 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be evaluating LLMs using the multiple choice paradigm. According to the GitHub repository, there are actually two different versions of the multiple choice paradigm: MC1 and MC2. What is the difference between MC1 and MC2? What is the difference between MC1 and text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of the multiple choice paradigm that you will be implementing is MC1.\n",

    "\n",
    "Take a look at the results reported for MC1 on the GitHub repository. Notice that all the results are below chance (.25).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2: Implement Experiment Pipeline (40 Points in Total)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will implement the TruthfulQA experiment by filling in the missing code from `truthfulqa.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 2a: Examine Dataset (No Submission, 0 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [a simplified version](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/truthful_qa_mc) of the TruthfulQA benchmark for this experiment, which has been converted into MC1 format and uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub. Please examine the format of the dataset and what kinds of questions and answers it contains."
